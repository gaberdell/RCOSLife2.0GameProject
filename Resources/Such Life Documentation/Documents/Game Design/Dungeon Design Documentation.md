# **[Dungeon Utility]**

Dungeons in this game serve as a place for the player to earn loot, experience, and raw materials through combat and mining.

# **[Dungeon Types]**

There are three types of dungeon, each serving a different utility to the player, each having different tilesets and aesthetics to each other.

Cave-type dungeon: These dungeons serve as a low-risk, low-reward area for players to mine raw materials without much hazard. There will be environmental hazards like lava or spikes, as well as the occasional enemy. There isn't much opportunity for gear, but the caves are rich with raw materials.

Dungeon-type dungeon: These dungeons are much more balanced between combat and mining. They're organized by rooms rather than caves, and have many more enemies. Chests and mini-bosses with gear have the opportunity to spawn here.

Tower-type dungeon: These dungeons are entirely combat oriented. They can only be entered using a tower dungeon key sold by the quartermaster. The player is to fight their way up to the top floor of the tower, where they will fight the boss. These dungeons will be the player's source of rare gear, and some high quality raw materials.
