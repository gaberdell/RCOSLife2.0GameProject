Story

We are an adventurer, setting out to explore un-charted territory

More ideas to consider:

Early game may not just be farming. What type of family you get born into may be chosen, ie Beggars, Farmers, Citizens, Nobility, Royalty, etc. You may then be prompted questions that will determine your base stats, your free stats, personality, etc. Examples may include “What will you do in this situation” or “You take an exam on history, what grade did you get”. These are randomized and are different depending on what type of family you are born into.

Another type of start is Isekai start. Similar questions will be asked, but they will also include things that occur in the modern world like “What major did you take” or “What was your job”, and your strengths and weaknesses will also be set accordingly. You may request “GOD” certain things like “A well-off family that have a good personality” or “A small but happy village” and stuff. There is a limit to the number of requests, but number may vary depending on how you died. If “GOD” accidentally killed you, you may have access to better requests. This also depends on the “GOD”’s personality. If the god is really mean, you might actually just get dropped into the world into a random poor place, even if they killed you by accident. In the case you get killed by accident, you may get the option to get revenge on the god, which will greatly boost your stat gains, or if the world has multiple gods, you may request help from gods that disagree with that god. There will always be a god that will disagree if more than 1 god is present.

Anyway, worlds usually have gods, a religion, and some sort of enemy. These will be randomly generated by the start of the world. You can choose your gender. If you are isekai’d, you may request your gender to be changed. If it is a mean god, they may change your gender for fun. If your gender was changed for fun, your character can either get used to it or not, which isn’t random and can be determined through your answers to questions relating certain matters. How all of this will be implemented will be determined when the game actually starts getting worked on.
